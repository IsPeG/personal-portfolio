      <p>
        OneSeventy is a urban jewelry brand created by 2 friends which contacted
        me for making the storefront and help them out with their e-commerce
        project.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, when they contacted me, I suggested them to create the online
        shop using Shopify. I knew it was one of the most popular platforms for
        making an online store as almost every shop I saw in the internet that
        was not a really big buissness used Shopify for the e-commerce. The only
        thing I was having doubts about was how to make the storefront. I knew
        Shopify had a default storefront with some themes for free, but the
        objective was to making a unique and fully customizable storefront.
        After some research, I found the <Link
          link="https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/"
          name="Hydrogen"
        /> framework, which is based on Remix for creating custom storefronts for
        Shopify and easy to deploy on the platform using Oxigen.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some time reading the docs and reviewing some tutorials on
        internet, I decided that Hydrogen and Shopify was the way to go and told
        my friends we could start the project.
      </p>
      <h3 class="noise-texture-text">Development</h3>
      <p>
        After creating the quickstart project and setting up the API keys, the
        development of the storefront started. It took several days to get the
        first version of the storefront ready to show the potential of it. Both
        of my friends liked it a lot. I was told to make some tweaks on the
        design so it could be more like how they had in mind. After that and
        setting up the domain, the first version of the storefront was online
        and ready to use for all customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second version of it added new tweaks on the design and new sections
        to the page:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first one is dedicated to the customers, showing comments and
          social media content they uploaded on the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          A know us section, which have a little introduction and the intentions
          of the brand, as well as some info about their creators
        </li>
        <li>A FAQ</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first collection was also disabled so the customers couldn't buy the
        items of said collection anymore but was left visible as a way to show
        them off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, im still adding the ideas they have to the page and assisting
        them with the use of Shopify.
