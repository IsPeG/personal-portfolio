    &emsp;&emsp;This was my first profesional project, made for an acquaintance
    of mine. I got requested to make a webpage for their car workshop. They
    wanted something simple so it was perfect for me to learn how to upload a
    page online. It was useful to learn how to buy and set up a domain too.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;For this project, I used pure HTML, CSS and JS with <Link
      link="https://getbootstrap.com/"
      name="BootStrap"
    />. For the comfort of the maintenance of the page, for the sections of
    "What do we do?" and "Prices", I created two separated js files with the
    information to generate those sections dynamicaly
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;If I made this page now, I would make a proper SEO technics,
    such as using more meta tags and using semantic html and optimize the images
    so they don't take so long to load.

    &emsp;&emsp;As my second profesional project, they requested me to make an
    information page for a catering company. This time, I tried to aim for a
    more distinctive and unique design, using a natural color palette with a lot
    of colors for making it more fun and pleasant to the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;For this project, I also used HTML, CSS and JS with <Link
      link="https://getbootstrap.com/"
      name="BootStrap"
    />, but this time also adding <Link
      link="https://jquery.com"
      name="JQuery"
    /> for easement and
    <Link link="https://scrollrevealjs.org" name="ScrollReveal" /> for animations.
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;If I made this page now, I would make a proper SEO technics,
      such as the ones said earlier, and optimize the images so they don't take
      so long to load.
