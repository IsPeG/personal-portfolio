  <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;This was my first profesional project, made for an acquaintance
    of mine. I got requested to make a webpage for their car workshop. They
    wanted something simple so it was perfect for me to learn how to upload a
    page online. It was useful to learn how to buy and set up a domain too.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;For this project, I used pure HTML, CSS and JS with <Link
      link="https://getbootstrap.com/"
      name="BootStrap"
    />. For the comfort of the maintenance of the page, for the sections of
    "What do we do?" and "Prices", I created two separated js files with the
    information to generate those sections dynamicaly
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;If I made this page now, I would make a proper SEO technics,
    such as using more meta tags and using semantic html and optimize the images
    so they don't take so long to load.

        <img src={Arrow.src} />
      </a>
    </span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;As my second profesional project, they requested me to make an
    information page for a catering company. This time, I tried to aim for a
    more distinctive and unique design, using a natural color palette with a lot
    of colors for making it more fun and pleasant to the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;For this project, I also used HTML, CSS and JS with <Link
      link="https://getbootstrap.com/"
      name="BootStrap"
    />, but this time also adding <Link
      link="https://jquery.com"
      name="JQuery"
    /> for easement and
    <Link link="https://scrollrevealjs.org" name="ScrollReveal" /> for animations.
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;If I made this page now, I would make a proper SEO technics,
      such as the ones said earlier, and optimize the images so they don't take
      so long to load.

  <h3>This Portfolio</h3>
  <p>
    I created this Portfolio to show my web developer career to other people. I
    wanted to use <Link link="https://astro.build/" name="Astro" /> as I saw that
    it was good for making static content webpages, so I gave it a try.
  </p>
  <p>
    The way the components work was not hard to learn as I already knew React. I
    learned the concept of layout with astro though. I knew that you can pass
    the children prop to a component in react to make a layout, but I didn't
    know it was called like that.
  </p>
  <p>
    From now on, I am going to use Astro for static web pages and not really
    complex ones as I feel really comfortable developing with it and it is easy
    to learn.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have planned to update this portfolio with new things, like a language
    changer, the navbar in a menu that always appear in screen on mobile, as
    well as update the information while I do new projects.
